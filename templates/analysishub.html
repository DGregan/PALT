                            The User Datagram Protocl (UDP) uses a simple connectionless transmission model.
                            It involves minimum amount of communication mechanism. UDP is said to be an unreliable
                            transport protocol
                            but it uses IP services which provides best effort delivery mechanism.
                            In UDP, the receiver does not generate an acknowledgement of packet received and in turn,
                            the sender does not wait for any acknowledgement of packet sent.
                            This shortcoming makes this protocol unreliable as well as easier on processing.
